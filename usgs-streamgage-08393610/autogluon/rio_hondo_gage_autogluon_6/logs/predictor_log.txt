Inferred time series frequency: 'H'
Provided train_data has 31610 rows (NaN fraction=1.5%), 2 time series. Median time series length is 15805 (min=15805, max=15805). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'series'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
