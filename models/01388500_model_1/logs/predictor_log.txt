Inferred time series frequency: 'h'
Provided train_data has 70068 rows (NaN fraction=0.0%), 4 time series. Median time series length is 17517 (min=17517, max=17517). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'series'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
